#TODO's

Capture todos here


- Set up some basic unit tests
  - Test script (don't run while system is running)
- build interface to interact with SMS Services (that can be extended beyond just SMS)
  - Nexmo
  - Twilio
  - Way2Mint
- more conversations
  - Query well information!
- Fix the way we handle responses from MyWell - right now we just assume that everything is ok, but this doesn't work for handling queries instead of simply submissions.

- replace isNullOrUndefined
